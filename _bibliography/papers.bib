Title = {Semantic-enhanced topic evolution analysis: a combination of the dynamic
   topic model and word2vec},
Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},

Volume = {127},

Pages = {1543-1563},
Abstract = {The combination of the topic model and the semantic method can help to
   discover the semantic distributions of topics and the changing
   characteristics of the semantic distributions, further providing a new
   perspective for the research of topic evolution. This study proposes a
   solution for quantifying the semantic distributions and the changing
   characteristics based on words in topic evolution through the Dynamic
   topic model (DTM) and the word2vec model. A dataset in the field of
   Library and information science (LIS) is utilized in the empirical
   study, and the topic-semantic probability distribution is derived. The
   evolving dynamics of the topics are constructed. The characteristics of
   evolving dynamics are used to explain the semantic distributions of
   topics in topic evolution. Then, the regularities of evolving dynamics
   are summarized to explain the changing characteristics of semantic
   distributions in topic evolution. Results show that no topic is
   distributed in a single semantic concept, and most topics correspond to
   various semantic concepts in LIS. The three kinds of topics in LIS are
   the convergent, diffusive, and stable topics. The discovery of different
   modes of topic evolution can further prove the development of the field.
   In addition, findings indicate that the popularity of topics and the
   characteristics of evolving dynamics of topics are irrelevant.},

Title = {Combining deep neural network and bibliometric indicator for emerging
   research topic prediction},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Predicting emerging research topics is important to researchers and
   policymakers. In this study, we propose a two-step solution to the
   problem of emerging topic prediction. The first step forecasts the
   future popularity score, a novel indicator reflecting the impact and
   growth, of candidate topics in a time-series manner. The second step
   selects novel topics from the candidates predicted to be popular in the
   first step. Terms with domain characteristics are used as candidate
   topics. Deep neural networks, specifically LSTM and NNAR, are applied
   with nine features of topics to predict popularity score. We evaluated
   the models and five baselines on two datasets from two perspectives,
   i.e., the ability to (1) predict the correct indicator value and (2)
   reconstruct the optimal ranking order. Two types of training strategies
   were compared, including a global strategy that trains a model with all
   topics and two local strategies that train separate models with
   different groups of topics. Our results show that LSTM and NNAR
   outperform other models in predicting the value of popularity score
   measured by MAE and RMSE, while LightGBM is a competitive baseline in
   ranking the topics in terms of NDCG@20. The performance difference of
   global and local strategies is not significant. Emerging topics
   predicted by our approach are compared with those by other methods. A
   qualitative assessment on nominated emerging topics suggests topics
   nominated by machine learning methods are more alike than those by the
   rulebased model. Some important topics are nominated according to a
   preliminary literature analysis. This study exploited the strengths of
   both machine learning and bibliometric indicator approaches for emerging
   topic prediction. Deep neural networks are applied where objective
   optimization target can be defined and measured. Bibliometric indicator
   offers an efficient way to select novel topics from candidates. The
   hybrid approach shows promise in considering various characteristics of
   emerging topics when making predictions.},

Title = {Finding citations for PubMed: a large-scale comparison between five
   freely available bibliographic data sources},
Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {12},
Pages = {9519-9542},
Abstract = {As an important biomedical database, PubMed provides users with free
   access to abstracts of its documents. However, citations between these
   documents need to be collected from external data sources. Although
   previous studies have investigated the coverage of various data sources,
   the quality of citations is underexplored. In response, this study
   compares the coverage and citation quality of five freely available data
   sources on 30 million PubMed documents, including OpenCitations Index of
   CrossRef open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI), Dimensions, Microsoft
   Academic Graph (MAG), National Institutes of Health's Open Citation
   Collection (NIH-OCC), and Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC).
   Three gold standards and five metrics are introduced to evaluate the
   correctness and completeness of citations. Our results indicate that
   Dimensions is the most comprehensive data source that provides
   references for 62.4\% of PubMed documents, outperforming the official
   NIH-OCC dataset (56.7\%). Over 90\% of citation links in other data
   sources can also be found in Dimensions. The coverage of MAG, COCI, and
   S2ORC is 59.6\%, 34.7\%, and 23.5\%, respectively. Regarding the
   citation quality, Dimensions and NIH-OCC achieve the best overall
   results. Almost all data sources have a precision higher than 90\%, but
   their recall is much lower. All databases have better performances on
   recent publications than earlier ones. Meanwhile, the gaps between
   different data sources have diminished for the documents published in
   recent years. This study provides evidence for researchers to choose
   suitable PubMed citation sources, which is also helpful for evaluating
   the citation quality of free bibliographic databases.},

Title = {A novel approach to measuring science-technology linkage: From the
   perspective of knowledge network coupling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Identifying and measuring science-technology linkage is important for
   understanding interactions between science and technology (S\&T).
   Previous studies have focused mainly on knowledge linkages of knowledge
   systems between S\&T but have ignored their structural linkages. To this
   end, we propose a novel knowledge network coupling approach to gauge
   network linkage between S\&T by integrating knowledge linkages and
   structural linkages. Four network construction strategies were first
   adopted to determine appropriate knowledge networks of S\&T, and then
   their coupling strengths over time were calculated based on similarities
   of coupling nodes' degree distribution and similarities of coupling
   edges' weight distribution. An experimental study in the field of energy
   conservation confirms that our approach was indeed successful in
   revealing interactions between S\&T. The proposed approach enriches the
   current methodology for measuring S\&T linkages and provides references
   for policymakers to conduct policy adjustments, by identifying the
   lead-lag relationship between S\&T.},

Title = {Potential index: Revealing the future impact of research topics based on
   current knowledge networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {As the volume of scientific publications has been growing at an
   increasingly rapid speed, it is important to identify prominent research
   trends for scientists and institutions. While a considerable number of
   researchers have attempted to map the current state of scientific
   research, more efforts should be made to reveal potentially influential
   research topics. In this study, we investigate the relationship between
   the scientific impact of a research topic and the structure of its
   knowledge network. A novel indicator, potential index , is proposed to
   model topic impact based on the structural information. It is an
   immediate indicator with two components: knowledge novelty and
   diversity, which are operationalized using the concepts of betweenness
   centrality and network entropy. The empirical results show that
   potential index serves as a good predictor of future topic impact, with
   a high R-2 and positive correlation. Its superiority sustains when used
   as the input feature of regression models. Moreover, the proposed index
   achieves better results, and the differences between it and other
   features become more prominent as the model complexity increases.
   Quantitative and qualitative analysis on the topic evolution process is
   also conducted to explain the change in the proposed indicator. This
   study contributes to the research of scientific impact modeling by
   establishing an explicit relationship between the impact of topics and
   the knowledge structure, and is thus helpful in predicting the potential
   impact of research topics.},

Title = {Exploring the effect of city-level collaboration and knowledge networks
   on innovation: Evidence from energy conservation field},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Collaboration and knowledge networks have been proved to play a crucial
   role in innovation. From a multilevel network perspective, this study
   integrates research on the two types of net-works and investigates how
   city-level collaboration and knowledge networks influence innova-tion in
   the energy conservation field. To this end, we calculate a city's
   influence force in its collaboration network based on the weighted
   PageRank algorithm and propose a novel measure-ment method of network
   embedding to gauge the embedding depth and embedding breadth of a city's
   local knowledge network in the whole knowledge network. Empirical
   results suggest that a city's aggregation index and influential force in
   the collaboration network are positively related to its innovation,
   while geographical distance shows an inverted U-shaped effect. The
   embedding depth and embedding breadth of a city's local knowledge
   network have a positive effect, and the structural entropy of its
   knowledge network generates an inverted U-shaped effect on innova-tion.
   Our research contributes to a better understanding of the impact of
   city-level collaboration and knowledge networks on innovation and points
   to several general implications for innovation practice and complex
   network research.},

Title = {Quantifying cross-disciplinary knowledge flow from the perspective of
   content: Introducing an approach based on knowledge memes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Knowledge flow between disciplines is typically measured through
   citations among publications. In this study, we quantify
   cross-disciplinary knowledge diffusion from the novel perspective of
   content by introducing knowledge memes, a special type of knowledge
   unit. Diffusion cascade is proposed to model the diffusion process of
   knowledge memes. By taking Medical Informatics (MI) as an exemplary
   interdisciplinary discipline, we measure the knowledge relationships
   between it and four related disciplines. The diffusion patterns of
   cross-disciplinary memes are also identified by analyzing the network
   structure of the diffusion cascade. The results present the knowledge
   relationships among disciplines measured by knowledge memes, which are
   different from those measured by citations. It is shown that
   preferential attachment takes effect in cross-disciplinary knowledge
   meme diffusion. In addition, cross-disciplinary knowledge memes
   generally originate earlier and have higher impact than the memes of MI.
   This study provides insights into new approaches to quantifying
   knowledge relationships among disciplines and furthers the understanding
   of content diffusion mechanisms through measurable knowledge units. (C)
