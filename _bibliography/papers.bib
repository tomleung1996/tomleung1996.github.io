Title = {Research complexity increases with scientists’ academic age: Evidence from library and information science},
Journal = {Journal of Informetrics},
Year = {2023},
Abstract = {With the continued aging of the scientific workforce, the impact of this trend on scientists’ research performance has attracted increasing attention. The literature has predominantly focused on the productivity, impact, and collaboration pattern of scientists of different ages. A research gap is found in investigating the differences in the research topics studied by junior and senior scientists. This study focuses on the complexity of a scientist’s research portfolio (RPC). Based on the concept of economic complexity, RPC was measured to characterize the capability of scientists to study complex research topics. An economic algorithm was adopted to estimate RPC on heterogeneous author-topic bipartite networks using bibliographic data from the field of Library and Information Science between 1971 and 2020. Through comparisons among scientist groups, RPC shows promise in distinguishing outstanding scientists from peers who have similar values of other indicators (e.g., citations and H-index). The change in RPC was further probed across scientists’ careers and an increasing trend with academic age was found, even after removing the accumulated advantages of senior scientists. Moreover, top-ranked scientists distinguish themselves from their peers by a higher RPC in the first year and a greater growth rate during their careers. While many researchers have their highest RPC in the first year, most top-ranked scientists reach their peak RPC later in their careers. The results provide helpful references for studies on the aging effect in academia.},

Title = {Bias against scientific novelty: A pre-publication perspective},
Journal = {Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology},
Year = {2023},
Abstract = {Novel ideas often experience resistance from incumbent forces. While evidence of the bias against novelty has been widely identified in science, there is still a lack of large-scale quantitative work to study this problem occurring in the pre-publication process of manuscripts. This paper examines the association between manuscript novelty and handling time of publication based on 778,345 articles in 1,159 journals indexed by PubMed. Measuring the novelty as the extent to which manuscripts disrupt existing knowledge, we found systematic evidence that higher novelty is associated with longer handling time. Matching and fixed-effect models were adopted to confirm the statistical significance of this pattern. Moreover, submissions from prestigious authors and institutions have the advantage of shorter handling time, but this advantage is diminishing as manuscript novelty increases. In addition, we found longer handling time is negatively related to the impact of manuscripts, while the relationships between novelty and 3- and 5-year citations are U-shape. This study expands the existing knowledge of the novelty bias by examining its existence in the pre-publication process of manuscripts.},

Title = {Quantifying scientific breakthroughs by a novel disruption indicator
   based on knowledge entities},
Journal = {Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology},
Year = {2023},
Abstract = {Compared to previous studies that generally detect scientific
   breakthroughs based on citation patterns, this article proposes a
   knowledge entity-based disruption indicator by quantifying the change of
   knowledge directly created and inspired by scientific breakthroughs to
   their evolutionary trajectories. Two groups of analytic units, including
   MeSH terms and their co-occurrences, are employed independently by the
   indicator to measure the change of knowledge. The effectiveness of the
   proposed indicators was evaluated against the four datasets of
   scientific breakthroughs derived from four recognition trials. In terms
   of identifying scientific breakthroughs, the proposed disruption
   indicator based on MeSH co-occurrences outperforms that based on MeSH
   terms and three earlier citation-based disruption indicators. It is also
   shown that in our indicator, measuring the change of knowledge inspired
   by the focal paper in its evolutionary trajectory is a larger
   contributor than measuring the change created by the focal paper. Our
   study not only offers empirical insights into conceptual understanding
   of scientific breakthroughs but also provides practical disruption
   indicator for scientists and science management agencies searching for
   valuable research.},

Title = {Semantic-enhanced topic evolution analysis: a combination of the dynamic
   topic model and word2vec},
Journal = {Scientometrics},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1543-1563},
Abstract = {The combination of the topic model and the semantic method can help to
   discover the semantic distributions of topics and the changing
   characteristics of the semantic distributions, further providing a new
   perspective for the research of topic evolution. This study proposes a
   solution for quantifying the semantic distributions and the changing
   characteristics based on words in topic evolution through the Dynamic
   topic model (DTM) and the word2vec model. A dataset in the field of
   Library and information science (LIS) is utilized in the empirical
   study, and the topic-semantic probability distribution is derived. The
   evolving dynamics of the topics are constructed. The characteristics of
   evolving dynamics are used to explain the semantic distributions of
   topics in topic evolution. Then, the regularities of evolving dynamics
   are summarized to explain the changing characteristics of semantic
   distributions in topic evolution. Results show that no topic is
   distributed in a single semantic concept, and most topics correspond to
   various semantic concepts in LIS. The three kinds of topics in LIS are
   the convergent, diffusive, and stable topics. The discovery of different
   modes of topic evolution can further prove the development of the field.
   In addition, findings indicate that the popularity of topics and the
   characteristics of evolving dynamics of topics are irrelevant.},

Title = {Combining deep neural network and bibliometric indicator for emerging
   research topic prediction},
Journal = {Information Processing \& Management},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Predicting emerging research topics is important to researchers and
   policymakers. In this study, we propose a two-step solution to the
   problem of emerging topic prediction. The first step forecasts the
   future popularity score, a novel indicator reflecting the impact and
   growth, of candidate topics in a time-series manner. The second step
   selects novel topics from the candidates predicted to be popular in the
   first step. Terms with domain characteristics are used as candidate
   topics. Deep neural networks, specifically LSTM and NNAR, are applied
   with nine features of topics to predict popularity score. We evaluated
   the models and five baselines on two datasets from two perspectives,
   i.e., the ability to (1) predict the correct indicator value and (2)
   reconstruct the optimal ranking order. Two types of training strategies
   were compared, including a global strategy that trains a model with all
   topics and two local strategies that train separate models with
   different groups of topics. Our results show that LSTM and NNAR
   outperform other models in predicting the value of popularity score
   measured by MAE and RMSE, while LightGBM is a competitive baseline in
   ranking the topics in terms of NDCG@20. The performance difference of
   global and local strategies is not significant. Emerging topics
   predicted by our approach are compared with those by other methods. A
   qualitative assessment on nominated emerging topics suggests topics
   nominated by machine learning methods are more alike than those by the
   rulebased model. Some important topics are nominated according to a
   preliminary literature analysis. This study exploited the strengths of
   both machine learning and bibliometric indicator approaches for emerging
   topic prediction. Deep neural networks are applied where objective
   optimization target can be defined and measured. Bibliometric indicator
   offers an efficient way to select novel topics from candidates. The
   hybrid approach shows promise in considering various characteristics of
   emerging topics when making predictions.},

   freely available bibliographic data sources},
Journal = {Scientometrics},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {12},
Pages = {9519-9542},
Abstract = {As an important biomedical database, PubMed provides users with free
   access to abstracts of its documents. However, citations between these
   documents need to be collected from external data sources. Although
   previous studies have investigated the coverage of various data sources,
   the quality of citations is underexplored. In response, this study
   compares the coverage and citation quality of five freely available data
   sources on 30 million PubMed documents, including OpenCitations Index of
   CrossRef open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI), Dimensions, Microsoft
   Academic Graph (MAG), National Institutes of Health's Open Citation
   Collection (NIH-OCC), and Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC).
   Three gold standards and five metrics are introduced to evaluate the
   correctness and completeness of citations. Our results indicate that
   Dimensions is the most comprehensive data source that provides
   references for 62.4\% of PubMed documents, outperforming the official
   NIH-OCC dataset (56.7\%). Over 90\% of citation links in other data
   sources can also be found in Dimensions. The coverage of MAG, COCI, and
   S2ORC is 59.6\%, 34.7\%, and 23.5\%, respectively. Regarding the
   citation quality, Dimensions and NIH-OCC achieve the best overall
   results. Almost all data sources have a precision higher than 90\%, but
   their recall is much lower. All databases have better performances on
   recent publications than earlier ones. Meanwhile, the gaps between
   different data sources have diminished for the documents published in
   recent years. This study provides evidence for researchers to choose
   suitable PubMed citation sources, which is also helpful for evaluating
   the citation quality of free bibliographic databases.},

Abstract = {Identifying and measuring science-technology linkage is important for
   understanding interactions between science and technology (S\&T).
   Previous studies have focused mainly on knowledge linkages of knowledge
   systems between S\&T but have ignored their structural linkages. To this
   end, we propose a novel knowledge network coupling approach to gauge
   network linkage between S\&T by integrating knowledge linkages and
   structural linkages. Four network construction strategies were first
   adopted to determine appropriate knowledge networks of S\&T, and then
   their coupling strengths over time were calculated based on similarities
   of coupling nodes' degree distribution and similarities of coupling
   edges' weight distribution. An experimental study in the field of energy
   conservation confirms that our approach was indeed successful in
   revealing interactions between S\&T. The proposed approach enriches the
   current methodology for measuring S\&T linkages and provides references
   for policymakers to conduct policy adjustments, by identifying the
   lead-lag relationship between S\&T.},

Title = {Potential index: Revealing the future impact of research topics based on
   current knowledge networks},
Journal = {Journal of Informatics},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {As the volume of scientific publications has been growing at an
   increasingly rapid speed, it is important to identify prominent research
   trends for scientists and institutions. While a considerable number of
   researchers have attempted to map the current state of scientific
   research, more efforts should be made to reveal potentially influential
   research topics. In this study, we investigate the relationship between
   the scientific impact of a research topic and the structure of its
   knowledge network. A novel indicator, potential index , is proposed to
   model topic impact based on the structural information. It is an
   immediate indicator with two components: knowledge novelty and
   diversity, which are operationalized using the concepts of betweenness
   centrality and network entropy. The empirical results show that
   potential index serves as a good predictor of future topic impact, with
   a high R-2 and positive correlation. Its superiority sustains when used
   as the input feature of regression models. Moreover, the proposed index
   achieves better results, and the differences between it and other
   features become more prominent as the model complexity increases.
   Quantitative and qualitative analysis on the topic evolution process is
   also conducted to explain the change in the proposed indicator. This
   study contributes to the research of scientific impact modeling by
   establishing an explicit relationship between the impact of topics and
   the knowledge structure, and is thus helpful in predicting the potential
   impact of research topics.},

Journal = {Journal of Informetrics},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Collaboration and knowledge networks have been proved to play a crucial
   role in innovation. From a multilevel network perspective, this study
   integrates research on the two types of net-works and investigates how
   city-level collaboration and knowledge networks influence innova-tion in
   the energy conservation field. To this end, we calculate a city's
   influence force in its collaboration network based on the weighted
   PageRank algorithm and propose a novel measure-ment method of network
   embedding to gauge the embedding depth and embedding breadth of a city's
   local knowledge network in the whole knowledge network. Empirical
   results suggest that a city's aggregation index and influential force in
   the collaboration network are positively related to its innovation,
   while geographical distance shows an inverted U-shaped effect. The
   embedding depth and embedding breadth of a city's local knowledge
   network have a positive effect, and the structural entropy of its
   knowledge network generates an inverted U-shaped effect on innova-tion.
   Our research contributes to a better understanding of the impact of
   city-level collaboration and knowledge networks on innovation and points

   content: Introducing an approach based on knowledge memes},
Journal = {Journal of Informetrics},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Knowledge flow between disciplines is typically measured through
   citations among publications. In this study, we quantify
   cross-disciplinary knowledge diffusion from the novel perspective of
   content by introducing knowledge memes, a special type of knowledge
   unit. Diffusion cascade is proposed to model the diffusion process of
   knowledge memes. By taking Medical Informatics (MI) as an exemplary
   interdisciplinary discipline, we measure the knowledge relationships
   between it and four related disciplines. The diffusion patterns of
   cross-disciplinary memes are also identified by analyzing the network
   structure of the diffusion cascade. The results present the knowledge
   relationships among disciplines measured by knowledge memes, which are
   different from those measured by citations. It is shown that
   preferential attachment takes effect in cross-disciplinary knowledge
   meme diffusion. In addition, cross-disciplinary knowledge memes
   generally originate earlier and have higher impact than the memes of MI.
   This study provides insights into new approaches to quantifying
   knowledge relationships among disciplines and furthers the understanding
   of content diffusion mechanisms through measurable knowledge units.},

abstract={[目的/意义]知识经济时代,知识的生产、扩散和消费是社会经济发展的重要推动力。其中,知识扩散是充分发挥知识价值的重要过程,从微观层面理解知识扩散的规律对促进知识利用与创新具有重要意义。[方法/过程]以医学信息学领域的科学文献为例,文章基于知识模因的微观层面,采用知识模因识别方法从文献中提取出知识模因来表征知识单元,并基于文献引证网络构建各知识模因的扩散级联网络,计算分析扩散级联网络的基础特征及其特征分布情况,以考察不同知识模因在学科领域内的扩散模式。[结果/结论]医学信息学领域内发现了四种典型的知识模因扩散模式:单起源型、多起源—独立型、多起源—迭代型、多起源—融合型。此外,通过对级联网络的各项属性分布特征进行分析发现,网络呈现无标度性,医学信息学领域极少数的知识模因获得了大量的传播资源,领域内的研究集中于被少数知识模因所代表的研究方向上,而领域内各研究方向的生命周期长度则相对差异较小。},
